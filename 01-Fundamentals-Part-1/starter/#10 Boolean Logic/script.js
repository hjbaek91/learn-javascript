// #10 Boolean Logic

// Boolean logic uses 'true' and 'false' values to solve complex logical problems.
// In this case, several logical operators are used at the same time.
// This is not only specific to JavaScript, but also to many other languages.

// Ex 1) (can be either true or false)
// A: Sarah has a driver's license
// B: Sarah has good vision

// -AND- (When both values are TRUE)
// Sarah has a driver's license 'AND' good vision --> True

// -OR- (When only one value is TRUE)
// Sarah has a driver's license 'OR' good vision --> True

// -NOT- (Inverts true/false value)
