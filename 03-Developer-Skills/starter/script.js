// using the 'Prettier' tool automatically structures our code to look more consistent.
// we can adjust the formatting rules of 'Prettier' by creating a separate configuration file and configuring preferrable settings.

// --SUCCESSFULLY LEARNING HOW TO CODE--

// Have a Clear Goal

// 1. Set a specific, measurable, realistic and time-based goal.
// 2. Know exactly why you are learning to code.
// 3. Imagine a big project you want to be able to build.
// 4. Research technologies you need and then learn them: JavaScript, React, etc.

// Actually try to Code

// 1. Understand the code that you're studying and typing.
// 2. Always type the code, don't just copy-paste.

// Reinforce your Learning

// 1. After you learn a new feature or concept, apply it immediately.
// 2. Take notes: hand-written, blog.
// 3. Challenge yourself and practice with small coding exercises and challenges.
// 4. Do not hurry in trying to learn something quick. Everyone has their own learning pace.

// Keep Practicing

// 1. Practicing on your own is the MOST important thing do do. Without practice, you will not get anywhere!
// 2. Come up with your own project ideas or copy popular sites or applications, or just parts of them in the beginning.
// 3. Do not become used to getting help from others all the time.

// Do not become Frustrated

// 1. Don't get stuck trying to write the perfect code. Just make sure the code works. Clean and efficient code will come with time.
// 2. No one is perfect and practice will help you become better.
// 3. If you have time, try refactoring your code.

// Don't Give Up!

// 1. Embrace the fact that you will never know everything.
// 2. Just focus on what you need to achieve your goal.
// 3. Even the best developers today continue to learn and make mistakes.

// Work with Others!

// 1. Work together with others and reinforce your knowledge.
// 2. Try explaining your knowledge to others.
// 3. You could even try to build a group project with others.
