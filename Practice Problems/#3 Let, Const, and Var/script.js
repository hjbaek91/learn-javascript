// #3 Let, Const, and Var

// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one).
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.

// let country = "Republic of Korea";
// let continent = "Asia";
// let population = 52;
// let isIsland = false;
// let language = Korean;

const country = "Republic of Korea";
const continent = "Asia";
let population = 52;
const isIsland = false;
const language = "Korean";
